> What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

The three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know are: how to type, superb attention to detail,
 and how to spot differences. 


> Please explain these three skills in your own words.

The ability to read and write is a neccessary skill because it's easier to write out code line if you don't have to
constantly stop and look at the keyboard. The ability to spot differences is useful because it will make finding any
variances in codes easier to spot. Attention to detail is extremely important because it ensures your code is as 
accurate and efficient as possible.

> Why do you need to not copy and paste?
 
It is important to not copy and paste because by doing so you lose the effectiveness of the exercises. By typing in all 
the codes by hand, you train your body and brain to learn the techniques being taught. 

> Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Practice and persistence is important because it will help teach the brain the concepts the author is trying to relay. 
If we persist it will not only build mental fortitude, but it will also help us get a better grasp of what we are learning.
